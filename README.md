Installation & Setup Instructions:
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/festive-sales-analysis-diwali.git
Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn statsmodels plotly jupyter
Download the Data

Analysis Steps:
Data Loading and Cleaning

Load the data using pandas and clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
sales_data = pd.read_csv('data/sales_data.csv')
customer_data = pd.read_csv('data/customer_data.csv')
Data Exploration & Visualization

Visualize total sales trends, customer segments, and product performance using matplotlib and seaborn:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.lineplot(x='Date', y='Revenue', data=sales_data)
Sales Forecasting

Use scikit-learn to build predictive models for sales forecasting based on historical data.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Customer & Promotional Analysis

Perform customer segmentation and analyze the impact of Diwali promotions on sales:
python
Copy code
customer_data['segment'] = customer_data.apply(lambda row: 'New' if row['purchase_count'] == 1 else 'Returning', axis=1)
Geographical Analysis

Analyze sales and performance by region, and visualize it using plotly for interactive maps.
python
Copy code
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter_geo(sales_data, locations='Region', size='Sales')
fig.show()
Usage Instructions:
View Sales Trends: Check the total revenue during Diwali and compare it with previous months to understand the impact of the festive season.
Analyze Product Performance: Use the interactive visualizations to identify the best-selling products and categories.
Evaluate Marketing Campaigns: Analyze the success of promotional campaigns (e.g., discounts, special offers) on boosting sales and customer acquisition.
Forecast Future Sales: Utilize the forecasting model to predict future sales during upcoming Diwali seasons based on historical data.
Segment Customers: Understand customer behavior by analyzing new vs. returning customers and how their buying patterns differ.
